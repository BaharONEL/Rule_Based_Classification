#### Ruled-Based-Classification 

**Dataset Story** :

• The persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products.

• The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.

**Business Problem**:

• A game company using some features of its customers wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) and to determine the segments according to these new customer definitions. Thus, it will be possible to estimate how much profit can be made per a customer in any segment.

• For example, It is desired to determine how much profit can be generated from a 25-year-old male user from Turkey who is an IOS user.

**Variables**:

• PRICE – Transaction Amount.

• SOURCE – The type of device the customer is connecting to (IOS/Android).

• SEX – Gender of the customer.

• COUNTRY – Country of the customer.

• AGE – Age of the customer.
